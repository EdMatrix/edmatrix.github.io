Federated Machine Learning (P3652.1) defines a machine learning framework that allows a collective model to be constructed from data that is distributed across data owners who are not allowed to share the actual data, which is often the case in educational data mining.

This is an IEEE working group with a draft charter. It appears to be oriented around AI - Machine Learning, not human learning. If a standard gets written and/or the group is shown to be applying the principles to student learning/education then it will be moved to the standards and/or workgroup tables.
