The HR Open Standards Consortium is the only independent, non-profit, volunteer-led organization dedicated to the development and promotion of a standard suite of specifications to enable human resource related data exchanges.

Not sure this belongs in EdMatrix. Two objections: 1. It's an organization rather than a standard (though there probably are standards that the organiation publishes. 2. Human resources are important to educational institutions but they are not directly related to teaching and learning which is the focus of EdMatrix. For similar reasons, the Ed-Fi Finance standard is not included on EdMatrix.
