The Student Data Privacy Consortium (SDPC) is collaborative of schools, districts, regional, territories and state agencies, policy makers, trade organizations and marketplace providers addressing real-world, adaptable, and implementable solutions to growing data privacy concerns.

This appears to be a workgroup, not yet a standard or specification. Therefore I don't think it belongs in the standards table until they publish a standard of some sort.
