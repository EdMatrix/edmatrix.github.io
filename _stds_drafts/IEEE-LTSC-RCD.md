**Data Model for Reusable Competency Definitions:** Defines a data model for describing, referencing, and sharing competency definitions, primarily in the context of online and distributed learning. This Standard provides a way to represent formally the key characteristics of a competency, independently of its use in any particular context.

The [IEEE RCD 2.0 Workgroup](http://sites.ieee.org/sagroups-1484-20-1/) is working on an update to this 2008 standard.
