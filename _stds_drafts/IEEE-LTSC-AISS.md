Adaptive Instructional Systems Study Group (P2274) Standards to support adoption of a group of AI-enhanced product categories that includes adaptive/personalized instruction, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, content recommenders, and so on. Three working groups are now defining the conceptual model and terminology; component interoperability specs; and best practices for evaluating these products.

This is still a study group. Once it publishes standards we'll include those in the EdMatrix table.
