Industry Connections Industry Consortium on Learning Engineering (ICICLE) is an open forum and community-building platform for defining and supporting the profession of Learning Engineering -- the engineers who will design, build, deploy, operate, and maintain the increasingly complex products and systems used in education and training.

ICICLE is a great organization but it has not yet published any standards. It will be included in the working groups table once that is created.
