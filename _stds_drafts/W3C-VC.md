Verifiable Credential This specification provides a mechanism to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

Not exclusive to education. It's not yet clear whether this new specification will be adopted by the education community or if one of the competing standards will gain traction. Probably appropriate to put on the "watch list" when that's created.
