# About EdMatrix

EdMatrix is a cooperative effort to create a directory of Education Standards. The emphasis is on Education Data standards but important Competency & Achievement standards and Design & Practice standards are also included.

Source to the site is [on GitHub here](https://github.com/EdMatrix/edmatrix.github.io).

EdMatrix would not be possible without the generous effort of many people. We encourage individuals and organizations involved in education standards work to submit updates and corrections. [Click here for guidelines](/contribute.html).
