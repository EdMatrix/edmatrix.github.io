# About EdMatrix

EdMatrix is a cooperative effort to create a directory of Learning Data Standards. The primary dimensions by which the standards are categorized are [A Taxonomy of Learning Data Standards](/Dimensions#taxonomy) (vertical) and [A Four-Layer Framework for Data Standards](/Dimensions#fourlayer) (horizontal). Please explore those descriptions to better interpret the table.

Source to the site is [on GitHub here](https://github.com/EdMatrix/edmatrix.github.io).

EdMatrix would not be possible without the generous effort of many people. We encourage individuals and organizations involved in education standards work to submit updates and corrections. [Click here for guidelines](/contribute.html).
