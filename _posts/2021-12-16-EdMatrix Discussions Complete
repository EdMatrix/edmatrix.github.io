Today we completed our series of EdMatrix discussions. The meetings have been very successful.

Specific achievements are:

* We confirmed the four-layer framework (the x axis in the matrix) for data standards with no material changes.
* We had very productive discussions about the Learning Technology Taxonomy (the y axis in the matrix) and have refined it considerably from the prior version.
* We have some solid ideas on how to update the visualization of the matrix to accommodate a much larger pool of standards.

We will publish a report in late January and then make plans for deployment of the updates.

Many thanks to Larry Fruth and [Data Standards United](https://datastandardsunited.org/) for organizing the meetings and recruiting an excellent set of experts to inform the work!
