Today, I have posted updated descriptions for [A Taxonomy of Education Standards](https://www.edmatrix.org/TaxonomyAndLayers.html#taxonomy) and the [Four-Layer Framework for Data Standards](https://www.edmatrix.org/TaxonomyAndLayers.html#fourlayer). I also added an entry for [IEEE LOM](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1484_12_1-2002.html).

Coming soon will be a directory of education standards organizations. If you have suggestions, please post them in the [issues forum](https://github.com/EdMatrix/edmatrix.github.io/issues) on GitHub.
