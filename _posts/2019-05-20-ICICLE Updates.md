This is a retrospective post since the news feature wasn't added to EdMatrix until August 2019.

For the [2019 IEEE ICICLE Conference](https://www.ieeeicicle.org/) we coordinated a number of updates to EdMatrix. First, we updated the Taxonomy of Education Standards which makes up the vertical dimension. The new version focuses on data standards with major divisions for Organizational Data and Pedagogical Data and a special category for Foundational Standards. It also includes special categories for Competency & Achievement Standards and for Design & Practice Standards. These latter categories are not data standards but focus on other aspects of the learning experience.

The updates have been well-received but have provoked additional work.
