This is a retrospective post since the news feature wasn't added to EdMatrix until late August 2019.

No, this is not a solicitation for financial contributions (though I wouldn't mind). Rather, I am pleased to announce that EdMatrix.org is ready for the community to contribute updates to the directory. Please check out the [Contributing Updates](https://www.edmatrix.org/contribute.html) page for instructions on how you can help ensure completeness and quality in the EdMatrix.
