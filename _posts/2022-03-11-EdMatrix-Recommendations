In November and December 2022 we held a series of discussions around how EdMatrix should be updated and enhanced. Originally I planned to get a report out in January but it's taken a little longer.

The draft report is now available and ready for review and comments.

The report is [posted here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lnxEzRm6EEvN36QyhTFwtucELNM7-Tqth78DIBerZQ/edit?usp=sharing).

For reference, the raw notes from the meetings are [posted here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejofGaZiOYVsGgAI97Bhhwx5UNDzDf4o1K_pskv4Ij8).

Please consider reviewing the report and offering your feedback.
