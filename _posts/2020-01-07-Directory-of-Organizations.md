Today I'm pleased to announce the new [Directory of Standards Organizations](https://www.edmatrix.org/organizations.html) on [EdMatrix](https://www.edmatrix.org). We now have a concise list of organizations that develop learning technology standards.

Selecting the "more" link after the organization description will take you to a dedicated page for that standards organization including a list of the standards listed on EdMatrix that are governed by that organization.

As always, if there's a standard that you think should be included, or a description that needs improvement, [please contribute](https://www.edmatrix.org/contribute.html)!
