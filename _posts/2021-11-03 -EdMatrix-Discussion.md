Today we held the first of four discussion group meetings to inform the next iteration of EdMatrix. The meetings are being organized by [Data Standards United](https://datastandardsunited.org/). The four meetings will bi-weekly.

Our goals are:

* Ensure that the EdMatrix directory serves the constituent audiences.
* Refine the taxonomy "buckets" through constructive input from an expert community.
* Develop a visualization that supports inclusion of a large number and variety of learning technology standards.
