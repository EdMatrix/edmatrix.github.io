This is a retrospective post since the news feature wasn't added to EdMatrix until August 2019.

EdMatrix is based on two previous efforts. I developed the [Four-Layer Framework for Data Standards](/fourlayerframework.pdf) in 2012 to [support the CEDS Stakeholders' Group](https://www.ofthat.com/2012/10/ceds-and-four-layer-framework-for-data.html). They were making decisions about the scope of [Common Education Data Standards](https://ceds.ed.gov) project.

Approximately a year later, I developed [A Taxonomy of Education Standards](/taxonomyofstandards.pdf) which was used by [SETDA](http://www.setda.org) in their publication [Transforming Data to Information in Service of Learning](http://www.setda.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Data-to-Information.pdf). Shortly after that, someone asked if the two frameworks could be used and the [EdMatrix](/matrix.html) diagram was born. In 2015 I created EdMatrix.org as a support site where the latest versions of these documents could reside.
